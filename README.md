# ComputerGame

## Description 
Welcome to our Software Engineering Project. The goal of our project is to create a 2D computer game with .Net and the MonoGame-Framework.
In this game the player has the task of jumping from one platform to another platform in a specific time limit. The player earns points for each visited platform.
The game is lost when the time has run out or if the player falls of a platform.

## How to play the game
The game is a jump and run game with a time limit. The player has the task of jumping from one platform to another platform where the distance is calculated by a random number.
* The player can use the key *A* to walk left and *D* to walk right. 
* The player can press the *Shift* key as well as the *A* or *D* key to run left or right.
* The player can press the *Space* key to jump and the player can move left or right in the air if the left or right movement is active as well.
